# State and storage
A bot is inherently stateless. Once your bot is deployed, it may not run in the same process or on the same machine from one turn to the next. However, your bot may need to track the context of a conversation, so that it can manage its behavior and remember answers to previous questions. The state and storage features of the SDK allow you to add state to your bot.
