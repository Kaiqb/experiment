# Help users navigate
In a traditional application, the user interface (UI) is a series of screens. Like apps and websites, bots have a UI, but it is made up of dialogs, rather than screens. In this module, you'll learn to use buttons, cards, and other types of attachments to help users navigate as they converse with your bot.
