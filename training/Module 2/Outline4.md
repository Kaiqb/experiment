# Greet users
The primary goal when creating any bot is to engage your user in a meaningful conversation. One of the best ways to achieve this goal is to ensure that from the moment a user first connects, they understand your bot’s main purpose and capabilities, the reason your bot was created. A welcome message should be generated whenever your users first interacts with your bot. To achieve this, you can monitor your bot’s Activity types and watch for new connections.
