What is a Tsunami?	Tsunamis are a series of very long waves generated by any rapid, large-scale disturbance of the sea. Most are generated by sea floor displacements from large undersea earthquakes.	WeatherFAQ.xlsx		[]	false	[]	1

What is Humidity?	Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air and can be described in different ways.	WeatherFAQ.xlsx		[]	false	[]	2
What is the Dew Point?	The dew point temperature is the temperature to which the air must be cooled to reach saturation (assuming air pressure remains the same). The dew point is a direct measure of the amount of moisture present in the air, and directly affects how you feel... or in other words... measures the amount of humidity in the air.

Why does it Rain?	Rain is the result of water droplets gathering together in clouds and gravity causing the water droplets to fall as rain. Warm air has more water droplets than cold air. Rain is part of the water cycle.	WeatherFAQ.xlsx		[]	false	[]	5

Why does it Snow?	Snow storms are usually caused by rising moist air within a extratropical cyclone (low pressure area). The cyclone forces a relatively warm, moist air mass up and over a cold air mass. If the air near the surface is not sufficiently cold over a deep enough layer, the snow will fall as rain instead.

What is Weather?	Weather is the state of the atmosphere, describing for example the degree to which it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy.	WeatherFAQ.xlsx		[]	false	[]	7

What Causes Wind?	Wind is caused by air flowing from high pressure to low pressure. The Earth’s rotation prevents that flow from being direct, but deflects it side to side(right in the Northern Hemisphere and left in the Southern), so wind flows around the high and low pressure areas.
