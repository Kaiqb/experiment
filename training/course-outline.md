# Course: Introduction to Bot Framework
This two-day course provides introduction to the Bot Framework SDK v4. The course covers concepts that are essential to building bots and provides opportunity to practice these concepts using hands-on labs. At the end of the course, participants will have a working Weather Bot that can be deployed to Azure.

## Module 1: Introduction to the world of bots
Objective: Familiarize participants with the an overview of the world of bots

In this module, you'll learn what a bot is, play with with a few bots, understand what is involved in making a bot, how do bots work, and what is the Azure Bot Service.

## Module 2: System set up

In this module, you will get your development environment set up to work with the [Azure Bot Service and the Bot Builder SDK.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-overview-introduction?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) First, we
will walk through the tools needed to develop and run a bot locally on your laptop. Then, we'll put together the first pieces
of a brand new bot.

## Module 3: Run a simple bot
In this module, you'll learn how to process incoming message event to access and use the text of the user's message. We'll go over the concepts of an "activity" and how to appropriately respond to the incoming activities from the user to the bot. 

## Module 4: Greet users
The primary goal when creating any bot is to engage your user in a meaningful conversation. One of the best ways to achieve this goal is to ensure that from the moment a user first connects, they understand your bot’s main purpose and capabilities, the reason your bot was created. A welcome message should be generated whenever your users first interacts with your bot. To achieve this, you can monitor your bot’s Activity types and watch for new connections. 

## Module 4: Store information
A bot is inherently stateless. Once your bot is deployed, it may not run in the same process or on the same machine from one turn to the next. However, your bot may need to track the context of a conversation, so that it can manage its behavior and remember answers to previous questions. The state and storage features of the SDK allow you to add state to your bot.
